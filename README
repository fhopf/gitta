Gitta - an IRC bot that can monitor Git repositories and log commits in IRC.

Can join channels and contains some needed tests.

Run using Maven: mvn scala:run -DmainClass=org.synyx.git.App

Run using Gradle: gradle run

This is my first project in Scala so it's likely that the code will be quite Javaesque.
